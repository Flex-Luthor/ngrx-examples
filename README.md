# NgRx Store Examples : Based On Official Redux Examples

[Redux Examples](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples) written using Angular 2 + NgRx store.

###Goal

These examples illustrate how to utilize NgRx store within your Angular 2 application. Projects are current based off official Redux examples, ported to Angular 2 and NgRx. This repository will be actively maintained and updated as new tools (dev tools?) and functionality (middleware?) become available and best practices are established. Feel free to contribute any examples or resources of your own the community may find useful!

###Build

Project builds are a stripped down version of Angular class Webpack starter, an exceptional Angular 2 seed project.
Tests can be executed with either WallabyJS or Karma (soon!).
